# WExercise

## Documentation

I used android studio to do this exercise. To test you would just have to install android studio. Then run an emulator to be able to interact with the program. 
I used a pixel 3 when testing so you may want to use a similar sized phone. From there you should just be able to import the folder above to run the program. 
If you just want to directly see the written code just follow the path: WExercise/WebServiceExercise/app/src/main/java/com/example/webserviceexercise/

## Picture
I also provided a picture of how the program behaved on my end just in case that helps.
